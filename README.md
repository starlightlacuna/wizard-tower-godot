This game is an open source remake of a game jam entry made in [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for the [2024 GameDev.tv Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2024). That original version of the game can also be played on Itch.io:

## Differences from the Jam Version

* Completely remade in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
* Revised waves and levels.
* Updated start menu background and cover art.
* Updated volume settings menu.
* New power up indicator.

## Building and Development

This project was made using Godot 4.4.1. It is written entirely in GDScript, so the standard  version of the engine is sufficient.

You can download the engine from https://godotengine.org/download/.
